Independent Honors Project - Social Media Usage, SMU Addiction, SMU Motivation and Young Adults' Health during and after the Pandemic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my research project, I wanted to answer the following hypothesis questions:

H1a: Considering at T1, most students are required to quarantine at home, so they are more likely to get connected through social media than in T2 when schools resumed in-person classes.   Thus, I propose that young adults would report higher SMU intensity at the first timestamp than at the second timestamp.

H1b: Young adults' responses would indicate more severe SMU addiction problems at the second timestamp than the first timestamp.

H2a: We predicted that young adults who are high vs. low on SMU addiction show different patterns of SMU, and those different patterns are associated with better or poorer mental health. We did not advance specific predictions for specific SMU patterns but examined their relations in a more exploratory way. We expect the SMU patterns positively associated with SMU addiction to be associated with poorer mental health, whereas those associated with low SMU addiction would be associated with better mental health.

H2b: We also predicted that SMU intensity would be unrelated to mental health, physical health, well-being, and perceived stress in any direction among young adults.

H2c: We hypothesized that well-being, mental health, and perceived stress would increase SMU addiction problems.

H3: Finally, we expected to explore if particular motivations would lead to different patterns of SMU could lead to different effects on psychological and physiological health.

4. Primary Data Analysis
- Young adults' SMU was significantly higher during the pandemic than when in-person classes resumed
<img width="305" alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-01 at 8 19 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100061103/216215249-2fb72eb7-510a-49d3-a2f0-d62be68369a5.png">

- Interestingly, young adults' addiction score during the pandemic is much higher than that after the pandemic. However, considering addiction is considered to be a long-term mental illness, which shouldn't supposed to be relieved so quickly right after the pandemic. This could be influenced by the survey questions on measuring addiction and the different SMU patterns during and after the pandemic. I'm using ANOVA to try to figure this question out.

- If young adults used Instagram for Social Activity, this phenonmenon became evident

4. Conducted ANOVA test for H2a hypothesis to figure out if both SMU addiction and different SMU patterns influence young adults' health, or one of them plays the most important role.
